Hindi Wordnet Android Application 

A basic Hindi Wordnet mobile application which opens a mobile enabled interface in a WebView. This just serves the purpose of outreach of HWN to mobile users.
Also, an application with an offline browsing interface takes time to create, and a lot more of android expertise. It is just a start.
